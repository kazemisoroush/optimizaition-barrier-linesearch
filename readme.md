#Optimizaition Barrier function

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Matlab implementation of Barrier function. This function is used to alter bounded optimization problems to unbounded. After that, the algorithm uses LineSearch algorithm to solve the unbounded problem. The LineSearch algorithm uses Steepest Descent or Newton algorithm to determine the step direction, and uses Backtracking algorithm to determine step size.
